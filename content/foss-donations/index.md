# Support Dave Rolsky's FOSS work

Hi, you're here (I assume) because you want to give me some money in support of my FOSS work.

Here's a handy button for doing that ...

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="HEA86D3W3R5JL" />
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" title="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" alt="Donate with PayPal button" />

</form>

## Sponsor Me on GitHub

I've set up [my GitHub profile for sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/autarch/) if you'd like to do that.

## Invoice

Or [email me](mailto:autarch@urth.org) and I will provide you a fancy invoice instead.
