## Perl Core Documentation

I wrote [perlootut](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlootut) from scratch and
revised [perlobj](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlobj) from the ground up for the
Perl 5.16.0 release in 2012.

I made major edits to several other documents in the Perl core, including
[perlhack](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhack),
[perlhacktut](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhacktut),
[perlhacktips](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhacktips), and
[perlsource](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlsource).

## [Moose documentation](https://metacpan.org/dist/Moose)

I received a grant from The Perl Foundation in 2009 to work on the
documentation for Moose, an OO system for Perl.

I revised all of the existing API docs, wrote new cookbook recipes, and wrote
the [Moose::Manual](https://metacpan.org/dist/Moose/view/lib/Moose/Manual.pod)
documentation from scratch.

## Books

I contributed two chapters to [RT
Essentials](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rt-essentials/0596006683/)
from O'Reilly and Associates, published 8/2005.

I co-authored [Embedding Perl in HTML with
Mason](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/embedding-perl-in/0596002254/)
with Ken Williams from O'Reilly and Associates, published 10/2002. It is also
[freely available online](https://masonbook.houseabsolute.com/book/).
