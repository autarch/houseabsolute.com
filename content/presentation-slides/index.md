Slides for my conference presentations are available here.

Most of my newer slide decks have slides with very minimal content on
them. **The interesting bits are in the presenter notes, which are accessible by
pressing "s" while viewing the slides.**

The raw slides are available from [my presentations
repo](https://github.com/autarch/presentations/).

* [Introduction to Go][3] - See the linked GitHub repo for instructions on
  downloading and viewing the slides. They require the Go `present` tool to
  view.
* [Why Do Programmers Love Rust?][18]
* [Generating Rust from C with Perl][17]
* [Continuous Integration for Perl with Azure Pipelines][4] - This covers [my
  ci-perl-helpers project][5] and also talks about general Azure Pipelines
  features.
* [Make Your Technical Hiring Process Suck at Least 20% Less][8]
  * My thinking on this has evolved a bit since I last gave this
    presentation. I've written about this a few times on my blog:
    * [A Technical Hiring Process
      Revisited](https://blog.urth.org/2019/07/11/a-technical-hiring-process-revisited/) -
      This is my latest thinking on hiring processes.
    * [A Technical Hiring
      Process](https://blog.urth.org/2017/07/14/a-technical-hiring-process/) -
      This mostly matches the slides.
    * [Tech Interviewer
      Theory](https://blog.urth.org/2016/03/08/tech-interviewer-theory/) -
      This is about interviews specifically, including what you can learn from
      them and some questions to ask during technical interviews.
* [Dist::Zilla and My Bundle][10]
* [Classy Testing with Test::Class::Moose][9]
* [Stepford, a Thing Sort of Like Make][11]
* [Basics of Unicode in Perl][12] - I made this to present to my co-workers at
  MaxMind. It's never been given at a conference.
* [Intro to Object-Oriented Programming in Perl][13] (Perl 5)
* [A Date with Perl][14] - I've also called this Dates, Times, Perl, and You
  in the past.
* [Markdent: Event-Driven Markdown Parsing][15]
* [Tidy All the Things][6] - A presentation on [Tidyall][7], which [I no
  longer recommend
  using](https://blog.urth.org/2020/04/25/the-real-dirt-on-tidyall/). [Check
  out precious](https://github.com/houseabsolute/precious) instead.
* [Basic OO in Perl 6][16]
* [Introduction to Moose][2]
